- Agile vs DevOps

	DevOps is a methodology that combines software development (Dev) with operations (Ops). The intent is to enable communication between the teams so that they can build, test, and release software more quickly and with greater efficiency and speed. While Agile Methodology involves continuous iteration of development and testing in the SDLC process. This software development method emphasizes on iterative, incremental, and evolutionary development.

- Define CI, Continuous Delivery & Continuous Deployment

	Continuous Integration is a DevOps software development practice that enables the developers to merge their code changes in the central repository. That way, automated builds and tests can be run. The amendments by the developers are validated by creating a built and running an automated test against them.

	Continuous Delivery is a DevOps practice that refers to the building, testing, and delivering improvements to the software code. The phase is referred to as the extension of the Continuous Integration phase to make sure that new changes can be released to the customers quickly in a substantial manner.

	When the step of Continuous Delivery is extended, it results in the phase of Continuous Deployment. Continuous Deployment (CD) is the final stage in the pipeline that refers to the automatic releasing of any developer changes from the repository to the production.
